Project Overview
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive SQL data analysis using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. Below is an outline of the steps I followed:

1) Dataset Acquisition:

Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.

2) Data Preparation:

Decoded the dataset using Excel formulas, primarily the IF function, to clean and organize the data.
Created three tables: education_habit, personal_question, and family_question.

3) Database Setup:

Utilized the export functionality of pgAdmin4 to import the cleaned data into PostgreSQL tables.

4) Data Analysis with SQL:

* Executed basic queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
* Performed aggregation to summarize data using functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT.
* Applied filtering and sorting to refine data retrieval.
* Implemented join operations to combine data from multiple tables.
* Used subqueries for nested data retrieval.
* Conducted index optimization to improve query performance.
* Developed complex queries to handle advanced data analysis needs.
* Created views for simplified data access.
* Implemented triggers for automated actions based on database events.

This project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preparation to advanced SQL data analysis techniques, showcasing a robust approach to handling and analyzing data efficiently.
